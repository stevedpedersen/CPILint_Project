**Slide Deck Outline: CPILint - Governance in Action**

---

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
**Title**: BTP Integration Governance: Automating Compliance with CPILint  
**Subtitle**: Accelerating Standards, Scale, and Simplicity  
**Presented by**: Steve Pedersen  

---

**Slide 2: Why This Matters**  
**Header**: Enabling Better Operations Through Automated Governance  
- Key Goal: Reduce manual review effort and ensure conformity across BTP integrations
- CPILint = our MuleSoft Governance equivalent for SAP BTP
- Governance board launched this year — CPILint is our first major milestone

> **Impact Theme**: Faster, Better, Cheaper

---

**Slide 3: How It Works**  
**Header**: CPILint Brings Governance into the Pipeline
- Runs automatically during every CI/CD build
- Validates structure, naming, security, consistency
- Rulesets are modular & customizable per interface type
- Outputs: CLI logs + JSON + Dynamic HTML

> **Efficiency + Effectiveness** through automation

---

**Slide 4: What It Looks Like**  
**Header**: Real-Time Feedback & Shared Learning for Developers
- Jenkins integration triggers CPILint
- HTML report published with every build
- Direct mapping from iFlow to rule violations
- Devs can proactively check their own work, reducing sprint delays and costly rework

> "Governance-as-Code" increases Ease-of-Use + lowers support cost

---

**Slide 5: Unlocking KPI Visibility**  
**Header**: From Static Rules to Actionable Intelligence
- JSON output stored in DB (upcoming)
- Enables dashboards to track:
  - Rule conformance over time
  - Regression tracking
  - Standardization progress
  - Provides an incredibly detailed dataset which can directly correlate the business sense of good governance and strengthens our core service offerings. We can add it as part of the professional services we offer to other teams.
- Aligns to chapter goal: reduce manual effort, improve operations

> **Economical**: More visibility, fewer hours wasted

---

**Slide 6: Value to the Org**
**Header**: Faster, Smarter Integrations at Scale
- Reduces review overhead by 50%+, freeing up project leads to focus on more strategic priorities. Code review isn’t flashy — but this scales, and it sticks.+
- Early detection = cheaper remediation
- Standardized interfaces are easier to support & onboard
- Reusable for any team using BTP integrations

> Saves money, reduces delays, improves dev experience

---

**Slide 7: Looking Ahead**  
**Header**: Expanding the Tech & the Service
- Dynamically assign rulesets by integration pattern
- Governance metrics dashboard (Q2)
- Intake & review offering for project teams
- Train developers in standard lintable flows

> CPILint is just the foundation for full lifecycle governance

---

**Slide 8: Summary & Close**  
**Header**: CPILint: Practical Progress, Tangible Value
- CPILint aligns directly with our team mission: automate what was manual
- Delivers across Faster, Better, Cheaper and the 4 Es
- Sets us up to scale BTP integrations confidently & consistently

> **Next Steps**: Show early dashboard mockups, onboard more flows, promote internally
