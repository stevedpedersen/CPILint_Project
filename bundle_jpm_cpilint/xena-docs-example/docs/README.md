# XENA Docs Example

The XENA Docs example provides git versioned documentation hosted as pages in
Bitbucket source control server. The documentation is written in
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) enhanced by
[Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) which generates documentation website on the
fly by parsing the Markdown files. The dynamically created documentation website
is hosted via the Bitbucket pages.

Use of Docsify extends standard Markdown syntax to make documents more readable
and provides number of functional and visual improvements, including:

- Content inclusions
- Side menu - auto-generated or fixed
- Themes - configurable visual user experience.
- Plugins - improving user experience (ie tabs, search, emoji) - full list do
  Docsify Plugins]()

?> **NOTE:** Bitbucket pages plugin must be enabled for the specific branch
where the documentation is hosted. <br/>

## About Source Control hosted on-line documentation

The goal of hosting documentation in Bitbucket source control is to enable the close integration of the technical documentation with the code hosted in the repository as well as leverage git workflow for the submission / review / approval of the documentation content changes.

This site uses two markdown-based tools, that provide a visually enhanced user experience for the documentation content hosted directly ouf of Bitbucket.
