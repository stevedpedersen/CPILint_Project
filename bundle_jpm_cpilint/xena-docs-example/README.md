# XENA Docs Example

### This repository includes XENA example of git versioned documentation hosted as pages in Bitbucket source control server

The goal for Bitbucket hosted documentation is to enable close integration of
the technical documentation with the code managed in the same git repository and
benefit from the git based editing workflow. The documentation is written in
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) enhanced by
[Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) which generates documentation website by
parsing the Markdown files. The dynamically created documentation website is
hosted via the Bitbucket pages.

The documentation files and are maintained in
[/docs`](https://sourcecode.jnj.com/projects/asx-xena/repos/xena-docs-example/browse/docs)
folder allowing for easy addition to new and existing project

This feature is supported by XENA Open DevOps community and questions should be
